An Obligatory post (so it seems) for iOS developers to list all the tools they use (and sometmes dont use) to make thier development life easier. Heres mine, the ones I actually use...


### Designing
* [Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) -- Sketch is amazing, Designed with Mac/iOS in mind it takes designing for iOS to another level. Sketch really reminds me of MX Fireworks -- you know, before Adobe got thier hands on it. Simple yet powerful; vector editing, easy exporting. It will do all you need.

* [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com) -- For things non vector, Pixelmator is a great alternative to Photoshop and to Gimp.

* [The HIG](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html) -- Apple's Human Interface Guideline. This should be printed and on your desk **at all times**.

### Developing
* [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) -- Apple's flagship Objective-C development product. Xcode and I have a love hate relationship but I always come back to Xcode.

* [App Code](http://www.jetbrains.com/objc/) -- Jetbrains ultimate-all-in-one IDE for Objective-C development and it really is good. It provides features like; a refactorer that works, code completion that works, linting, automatic imports and import optimsation. It does however; lack an Interface Builder which for me, a dealbreaker.

* [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) -- No, I do not write Objective-c in sublime but part of my process is making little scripts in ruby to make my integrating and deploying tasks automated.

* [Cocoapods](https://github.com/cocoapods/cocoapods) -- **The** Dependency manager for Objective-C. NO more linker errors, no more importing projects or dealing with submodules. Enough said.

### Testing
* [Kiwi](https://github.com/allending/Kiwi) -- This was almost OCUnit but I have switch whole heartedly to Kiwi and BDD. It's not just about changing frameworks, its about changing the way you test.

* [Zucchini] (http://www.zucchiniframework.org) -- Acceptance testing, define flows, detect UI discrepancies and Integrate with CI.

### Integrating
* [xctool](https://github.com/facebook/xctool) -- Released by Facebook, xctool provides a nicer interface than xcodebuild with better test integration and reporting built in.

* xcrun -- Ships with Xcode, generate .ipa from .app with code signing, all you need really.

* [Testflight](http://testflightapp.com) -- Lucklily I had an account before apple's aquistion of testflight. Upload builds, add release notes, notify people.

* A CI Server -- Choose one, They all do basically the same thing. Define a workflow, add build steps and go, I use Jenkins.

###note
Although this did not make the list because it is still under beta, Github's Atom editor has quickly became a replacement for Sublime text 2.
